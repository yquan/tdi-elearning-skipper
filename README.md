# TDI eLearning Skipper

TDI website elearning process is quite annoying, though it's ensuring you go take time to review all the sections again!

I decided to create the Google Chrome Extension to ease the process.

## How does it work?

Basically, this extension would go through the DOM element on TDI eLearning page, and open the section url one by one in the chapter. After each of them had been opened, it will redirect the current active tab to the exam page so you could start the exam immediately. NOTE: I don't recommend you to take the exam immediately, you should go back to the section you misanswered carefully.
